# 《成长第二曲线》
"告诉我，你打算做什么，用你疯狂而宝贵的一生？" --美国诗人 玛丽奥利弗

我现在明白生命如此宝贵不能虚度，但我曾花了很长时间才把未来的生活看作一个机会，而不是一个难题。
我现在希望曾经的自己更狂野一点，多去拓展自己和冒险，拥有更多的想象力。
但可惜那时的我没有读过玛丽奥利弗的诗句和她那尖锐的问题。

Tell me, what is it your plan to do
with your one wild and precious life?

I know now that life is too precious a thing to waste, that it has to be more than something to be got through, but it took me time to see my future life as an opportunity not a problem. I wish now too that I had beed a bit more wild, that I had stretched myself more, taken more risks, been more imaginative. But I hadn't come accross Mary Oliver then and her very pointed question.
